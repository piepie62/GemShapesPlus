# GemShapesPlus

## Description
Gem Shapes Plus is a cosmetic mod for GCFW and GCCS.

It adds eleven new shapes for gem grades 13-23.

No gem stats are changed by this mod: all it does is make your game prettier.

## Installing the mod
### Important warning! Gem Shapes Plus depends on [Bezel Mod Loader](https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader).

**To install the mod** grab a release (links below) for your game version. Drop `GemShapesPlus-x.x.x.swf` into the `Mods` folder in the game's folder (To navigate to the game's folder: rightclick the game in steam -> Manage -> Browse local files).

# Building
To build GemShapesPlus, you must use the AS3 project located in [Bezel's repository](https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader) to build both GCFW and GCCS as libraries.
Place the resulting SWCs in your their corresponding game folders with the same file name as the SWF in that folder (e.g. `GemCraft Frostborn Wrath.swc`).
